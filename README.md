# Effinity Tag for Google Tag Manager Server Side

The Effinity Tag allows advertisers to store a server-side cookie and send a conversion event (S2S) to [Effinity](https://www.effinity.fr/ "Effinity's Homepage").

This tag tracks three events types:
- `page_view` reads effinity's query parameter from the URL (`eff_cpt`, `eff_sub1`, `eff_sub2`, `eff_pid`) and stores it on a server-side cookie named `effi`
- `purchase` sends the event to Effinity
- `generate_lead` sends the event to Effinity
